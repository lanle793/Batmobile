VR Driving with Joystick

This game is created for playing with HTC Vive. To use a physical joystick, you would need to install Driver4VR and antimicro.
With antimicro, you would be able to send input from your joystick to your computer keyboard. Driver4VR then would help you connect your keyboard to your Vive controller.
These 2 software combined would allow you to use your joystick to navigate inside the game environment.
